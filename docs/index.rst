Introduction
************

Profiles can help to identify different types of proteins in a particular database.

In this case we present the process for the creation of profiles for repeat proteins, to do so, some programs, datasets, and scripts are needed.

In this documentation we present all the information that will allow you to create your own profiles.

In the section :doc:`Requirements` you will find the :ref:`instructions` for the installing and download.

There is data that you might need, you can find the links from where you can download them in the section :doc:`Usefulllinks`.

For the creation of the initial sequence and structure alignments, if you are using structural information, we recommend the use of mustang. In the section :doc:`mustangHowto` you will find all the instructions to run a mustang example. How to install it is in the :doc:`Requirements` section.

Check out the :doc:`CreationProcess` section for the explanation of how :ref:`process` to create a new profile and search the matching results in a database.
