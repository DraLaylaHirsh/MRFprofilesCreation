How to run Mustang
==================
Mustang needs the structures that are supposed to be aligned and you need to say which are they.

Create the input file considering that the first line in the file should have the path in where the structures are and it must start with the > symbol
the next lines should start with the + symbol and be followed by just the name of the file.

So if you want to align the files




that are in the folder 


you just need to create a file that can have any extension, we use mus in the example, and it should contain the following text:






to have the aligned pdbs and fasta in an output called results you need to execute the following command line
/MUSTANG_v3.2.4/bin/mustang-3.2.4 -f example.mus -F fasta -o results

the program will return two files 
results.pdb
results.afasta

To see the results pdb you can use pymol and to see the afasta you can use belvu or seaview.

A zip file is provided for you to try the previous instructions
