Profiles Description
********************

Class III profiles descriptions:
=================================

III3_ARM_RDB (Alpha solenoid): 
------------------------------

The armadillo (Arm) repeat is an approximately 40 amino acid long tandemly repeated sequence motif first identified in the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity gene armadillo involved in signal transduction through wingless. Animal Arm-repeat proteins function in various processes, including intracellular signalling and cytoskeletal regulation, and include such proteins as beta-catenin, the junctional plaque protein plakoglobin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein, and the nuclear transport factor importin-alpha, amongst others. A subset of these proteins is conserved across eukaryotic kingdoms. In higher plants, some Arm-repeat proteins function in intracellular signalling like their mammalian counterparts, while others have novel functions.The 3-dimensional fold of an armadillo repeat is known from the crystal structure of beta-catenin, where the 12 repeats form a superhelix of alpha helices with three helices per unit. The cylindrical structure features a positively charged grove, which presumably interacts with the acidic surfaces of the known interaction partners of beta-catenin.


III3_ANK_RDB (Alpha solenoid): 
------------------------------

Ankyrin repeats (ANK) are tandemly repeated modules of about 33 amino acids. They occur in a large number of functionally diverse proteins mainly from eukaryotes. The few known examples from prokaryotes and viruses may be the result of horizontal gene transfers [PMID:8108379]. Many ankyrin repeat regions are known to function as protein-protein interaction domains. The conserved fold of the ankyrin repeat unit is known from several crystal and solution structures, e.g. from: - p53-binding protein 53BP2 [PMID:8875926], - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19Ink4d [PMID:9353127] , - Transcriptional regulator GABP-beta [PMID:9461436], - NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkB-alpha[PMID:9865693]. It has been described as an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta-hairpin and two alpha-helices[PMID:8875926].


III3_HEAT_RDB (Alpha solenoid): 
------------------------------

A HEAT repeat is a protein tandem repeat structural motif composed of two alpha helices linked by a short loop. HEAT repeats can form alpha solenoids, a type of solenoid protein domain found in a number of cytoplasmic proteins. The name "HEAT" is an acronym for four proteins in which this repeat structure is found: Huntingtin, elongation factor 3 (EF3), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the yeast kinase TOR1. HEAT repeats form extended superhelical structures which are often involved in intracellular transport; they are structurally related to armadillo repeats. The nuclear transport protein importin beta contains 19 HEAT repeats.


III3_IMB_RDB (Alpha solenoid):
------------------------------

This family consists of the importin alpha (karyopherin alpha), importin beta (karyopherin beta) binding domain. The domain mediates formation of the importin alpha beta complex; required for classical NLS import of proteins into the nucleus, through the nuclear pore complex and across the nuclear envelope. Also in the alignment is the NLS of importin alpha which overlaps with the IBB domain
[PMID:8692858]

  
III3_PF00004_RDB (Alpha solenoid): 
----------------------------------

AAA family proteins often perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the assembly, operation, or disassembly of protein complexes [PMID:9927482]
  


III3_PF00244_RDB
----------------

14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules that are expressed in all eukaryotic cells. 14-3-3 proteins have the ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors. More than 200 signaling proteins have been reported as 14-3-3 ligands. TPR like.


III3_PF00310_RDB
----------------

Glutamine amidotransferases class-II. TPR like.


III3_PF00400_RDB ( should be PF01603)
----------------

Methylation-regulated decommissioning of multimeric PP2A complexes. Designed Armadillo can be retrieved by this profile.


III3_PF00575_RDB (should be TPR like)
----------------

Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit gamma isoform.


III3_PF00613_RDB  (should be TPR like)
----------------

CLATHRIN HEAVY, Clathrin is a triskelion-shaped cytoplasmic protein that polymerizes into a polyhedral lattice on intracellular membranes to form protein-coated membrane vesicles. Lattice formation induces the sorting of membrane proteins during endocytosis and organelle biogenesis by interacting with membrane-associated adaptor molecules.


III3_PF00794_RDB  (should be TPR like)
----------------

Clathrin-coated vesicle formation is responsible for membrane traffic to and from the endocytic pathway during receptor-mediated endocytosis and organelle biogenesis, influencing how cells relate to their environment. Generating these vesicles involves self-assembly of clathrin molecules into a latticed coat on membranes that recruits receptors and organizes protein machinery necessary for budding. 


III3_PF01036_RDB  (should be TPR like)
----------------

Outer membrane protein assembly factor BamD


III3_PF01381_RDB  (should be TPR like)
----------------
PHOSPHOLIPASE A2-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, Structure and function of the PLAA/Ufd3-p97/Cdc48 complex.PLAA (ortholog of yeast Doa1/Ufd3, also know as human PLAP or phospholipase A2-activating protein) has been implicated in a variety of disparate biological processes that involve the ubiquitin system. It is linked to the maintenance of ubiquitin levels, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is unclear. 


III3_PF01730_RDB  (should be TPR like)
----------------
Alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein. Structure of 20S supercomplex determined by single particle cryoelectron microscopy (State II)


III3_PF01851_RDB
----------------
Proteasome/cyclosome repeat. A repetitive sequence in subunits of the 26S proteasome and 20S cyclosome (anaphase-promoting complex). Lupas A, Baumeister W, Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 22, 195-6, (1997). 


III3_PPTA_RDB
----------------
4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase superfamily. Members of this family transfers the 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) moiety from coenzyme A (CoA) to the invariant serine of Pfam:PF00550. This post-translational modification renders holo-ACP capable of acyl group activation via thioesterification of the cysteamine thiol of 4'-PP [PMID:7559576] . This superfamily consists of two subtypes: The ACPS type such as Swiss:P24224 and the Sfp type such as Swiss:P39135. The structure of the Sfp type is known [PMID:10581256], which shows the active site accommodates a magnesium ion. The most highly conserved regions of the alignment are involved in binding the magnesium ion.


III3_PUF_RDB:
-------------

Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. Swiss:P47135, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognise all 8 repeats in all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure [PMID:11336677, PMID:11336708].


III3_SEL1_RDB
-------------

This short repeat is found in the Sel1 protein [PMID:8722778]. It is related to TPR repeats.


III3_TAL_RDB
-------------

The proteins in this family bind to DNA. Each repeat binds to a base pair in a predictable way[PMID:22223736]. The structure shows that each repeat is composed of two alpha helices[PMID:22223736].


III3_TPR_RDB
