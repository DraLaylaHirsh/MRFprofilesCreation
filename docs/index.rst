Welcome to MRFprofiles Creation
===============================

Profiles can help to identify different types of proteins in a particular data base.

In this case we present the process for the creation of repeat proteins, to do so, some programs, datasets, and scripts are needed.

In this documentation we present all the information needed to do so.

In the section :doc:`Requirements` you will find the :ref:`instructions` for the installing and download.

There is data that you might need, you can find the links in the section :doc:`Usefulllinks`.

For the creation of the initial sequence and structure alignments, we recommend the use of mustang, if you are using structural information. In the section :doc:`mustangHowto` you will find all the instructions to run a mustang example. How to install it is in the :doc:`Requirements` section.

Check out the :doc:`CreationProcess` section for the explanation of how :ref:`process` to create a new profile.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
