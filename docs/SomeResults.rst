Some results for Reference organism
===================================

Using the profiles created during the secondment, we run Meta Repeat finder on different organisms from the super kingdom Archaea, Bacteria and Eukariota.
The results of each of them are presented in the following sections. Finally, in the last section we can see the repeat presence in a percentage inside all of them. All the data used to create the following images is in `here <https://github.com/DraLaylaHirsh/MRFprofilesCreation/blob/24e451c0edbb99804f525ff84763aef7becfe9a7/docs/ZarifaDataSetResults.ods/>`_


Archaea
-------
This graphic show as how TIM Barrels are highly present in all the archea organisms. We also can observe that in all of them there are always Beta Propellers some non solenoids and Closed Structutes from Class 4 that are not Beta Barrels, nor TIM Barrel nor Beta Propeller.
In almost all cases there are Alpha and Beta solenoids present, as expected.

Bacteria
--------
This graphic show as how Alpha Solenoids are present in all the bacteria organisms. We also can observe that in all of them there are always Non solenoid.
In almost all cases there are TIM Barrels and Beta Propellers present.

Eukariota
---------
This graphic show as how Alpha Solenoids are highly present in all the Eukariota organisms. We also can observe that in all of them there are always Alpha Beta Solenoids, Beta Propellers,  Non solenoids, FAB light chain and Closed Structutes from Class 4 that are not Beta Barrels, nor TIM Barrel nor Beta Propeller. In almost all cases there are  Beta solenoids, Beta Barrels, TIM barrels, Other beads on String different to FAB light chain present, as expected.

All
---
Finally, as shown in the following graph we can observe how in Archaea we can found the less quantity of repeat sequences, then we would find Bacteria, and the greatest number of repeat would be found inside Eukariota. In particular the Dario rerio organism(fish) with almost 10% of repeat found, then with almost 9% we can find Pan Pan_troglodytes(monkey), Xenopus_tropicalis, Mus_musculus, Bos_taurus and Homo_sapiens.
